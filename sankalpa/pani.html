            <h1><u>Preparation</u></h1>
            <p>A round shaped small crispy puri that is small enough to easily fit in your mouth, is a basic ingredient in many chaat recipes like pani puri, dahi puri etc. This puri is hollow that allows you to make a hole on top and fill it with varieties of stuffing like boiled potato, sprouted moong beans, boiled chickpeas, ragda etc., top with sweet and spicy chutneys to make tongue tickling chaats. Many like to enjoy it alone by just adding boiled mashed potato, coriander, few drops of lemon and a sprinkle of chaat masala powder. Making golgappa puri at home is is easy but time consuming affair if you want to prepare it in large quantity and so generally, I prefer to buy them from grocery store. However, store bought ones are generally large or very hard and ruins the excitement just after few mouthfuls. However, with this step by step photo recipe of golgappa puri, making right sized melt in the mouth puris for panipuri at home is super easy.</p>
