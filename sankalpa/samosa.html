            <h1><u>Preparation</u></h1>
            <p> Boil potatoes, peel and slightly mash.
                Boil peas and cabbage and keep aside.
                In a non stick pan, heat oil and add chopped onions until light brown.
                Add ginger paste, coriander, mint, green chile and fry for one minute.
                Now, add salt and the boiled peas, cabbage and mashed potatoes and stir well.
                Let it cook for a minute, remove from heat and keep aside.
                Mix flour and salt.
                Melt 3 tablespoons of butter and add to the flour and salt mixture and mix well.
                Add a few tablespoons of water at a time, to the mixture and make into dough.
                The consistency of the dough is similar to that of chapati.
                Divide the dough into walnut sized balls and flatten each ball to form a circle.
                The size of each circle is roughly six inches in diameter.
                Divide the circle into two (half circles).
                Wet the edges of each half circle.
                Place sufficient amount of stuffing in the middle of the half circle and fold the corners in, so that, the end result looks like a stuffed triangle.
                Pinch the edges lightly, they should seal easily because they are wet.
                In a wide skillet, heat oil over medium-low.
                When oil is hot, deep fry the stuffed samosas until they become pale brown in color.
                Remove from skillet and keep aside.
                After frying all the samosas to a pale brown color, re-fry them, over medium heat, once again to a deep brown color.</p>
